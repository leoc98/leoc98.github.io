# Clock
## Synchronization
* External Synchronization $\forall i, |S(t)-C_i(t)| \lt D_e$
* Internal Synchronization $\forall i, |C_j(t)-C_i(t)| \lt D_i$
* External Synchronization leads to $\forall i, |C_j(t)-C_i(t)| \lt 2D_e$

## Faulty Clocks
* Monotonicity condition (clock never go back) : $t'>t \Rightarrow C(t') \gt C(t)$
* crash failed: not working
* arbitrary failure: any failure other than crash
* correct clock $\nrightarrow$ accurate clock

## Synchronization bounds
* $\forall step_i \in process, B_l \le T(step_i) \le B_u$
* $|T_{MsgTransmit} | \le B$
* External Synchronization

### Optimal clocks setting
n denotes #clocks 
$$clocks = t + (Trans_{max} + Trans_{min})(1-\frac{1}{n})$$

### Synchronized methods
#### Cristian's
range $[t+min, t+T_{round}-min]$

set to $t+T_{round}/2$

#### Berkeley algorithm
* Master collects clock value from all slvaes
* use round trip time to estimate slaves' clock's values
* take average
* send back drift to slaves for adjustment

### Networkd Time Protocol(NTP)
* hierarchical shape : Primary Server (connected to UTC) => Secondary servers => Synchronization subnet => users' conputer
* hierarchy can be reconfigure when failres occur

#### Synchronization Modes
* Multicast
* procedure call
* symmetric
    * $d_i = T_{i-2} - T_{i-3} + T_{i} - T_{i-1}$
    * $o_i = T_{i-2} - T_{i-3} + T_{i-1} - T{i}$
    * $o_i-d_i/2\leq o \leq o_i+d_i/2$ 

## Logical Clock
notation
* a happen-before b: $a \rightarrow b$
* a happen-before b on process p: $a \rightarrow_p b$

definition of $a\rightarrow b$
* if $a,b$ in same process and a happen first
* if $b$ is a receive event and $a$ is corresponding sending event
* if $a \rightarrow c$ and $ c \rightarrow b$

### Lamport's Logical Clocks
every process has its timestamps $L_i$, and change by following rules:
* $L_i = 0$
* $L_i$++, if events happen in process i
* $L_i = max(L_i, L_j) + 1$, if process i receive message from process j with its timestemp $L_j$

$L(e) \lt L(e')$ if (not only if) $e\rightarrow e'$ 

### Vector Clocks
every process maintain a vector of all process, and change vector elements by following rules:
* $V_i[j] = 0$
* $V_i[i]$++, if events happen in process i
* $V_i[j] = max(V_i[j], t_j) + 1$, if process i receive message from process j with its timestemp $t_j$

# Global State
## Difficulties
Distributed 
* Garbage collection
* Deadlock detection
* Termination detection
* Debugging

## Cuts
assemble a meaningful global state from local stes recorded at different times

### consistnet cut
$$\forall e, e',e\in C, e'\rightarrow e \Rightarrow e' \in C$$

### run
total ordering of all events in a global history that is consistent with each process' local history ordering.
#### linearization (consistent run)
ordering of evnets in a global history that is consitent with the happened-before relation

### reachable state
$S'$ is reachable from $S$, $l$ is a linearization of states
$$\exist l, S\overset{l}{\rightarrow}S'$$

## Snapshot
to recover from termination
### consist
* local snapshot of basic state of each process
* channel state of basic messages of each channel

### Assumption
* communication not failed
* process use channel FIFO
* distributed network strongly connected (reachable for any pair of processes)
* unspecific (snapshot algorithm can start at any process)
* not freezing while snapshot running

### Chandy and Lamportâ€™s Snapshot Algorithm
#### control message (marker) handle 
* the inital process pretend received a marker
* when first time received, record states and receving channel (empty), send out a marker over all outgoing channel;
* when not first time received (from other channel), record all messages from start record (the first time received)

#### complexity
assume there are $e$ edges and the diameter of network is $d$
* #messages $\in O(e)$
* time consuming $\in O(d)$

#### consistent snapshots
* presnapshot event
* postsnapshot event
* reachability theorem: for a linerization series of event, exist a permutation of Sys which can be divided into presnapshot evnets and postsnapshot evnets from a point, that makes $S_{init} \overset{pre}{\rightarrow} S_{snap} \overset{post}{\rightarrow} S_{final}$

### Monitoring Alogrithm (Marzullo-Neiger)
* use a monitor process that connects to all other processes and doesn't interfere other processes
